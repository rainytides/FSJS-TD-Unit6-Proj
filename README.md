# My Portfolio Project

Welcome to my portfolio project! I designed this platform to dynamically and interactively showcase my web development projects. Each project within this portfolio has its own dedicated page, detailing its name, description, the technologies I used, and links to both the live version and its GitHub repository. I've also incorporated error handling mechanisms to ensure a smooth browsing experience.

## Technologies I Used

I built this portfolio using the **Express** framework for Node.js and chose **Pug** as the template engine. I store the data for my projects in JSON, ensuring easy updates and scalability. I've styled the application with CSS, aiming for a responsive design that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to View My Work

To take a look at my portfolio, simply navigate to the project directory in the terminal and type `npm start`. This command starts the Express server and will automatically open a browser window to display my work. If the browser doesn't launch automatically, you can manually visit `http://localhost:3000` to explore my projects.

## A Note from Me

Creating this portfolio has been a rewarding journey. It's not just a space to showcase my individual web projects but also a reflection of my dedication, technical skills, and passion for web development. I hope you have as much fun exploring my projects as I did creating them!
